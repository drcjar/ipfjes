\section*{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Interview Schedule }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Standard Operating Procedure }\DIFaddend for \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{case and control recruitment and exposure assessment in }\DIFaddend the Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Job Exposure Study (IPF JES)}

\DIFaddbegin \tableofcontents

\section{\DIFadd{Scope and applicability}}

\DIFadd{The purpose of this SOP is to describe the instructions for the enrolment of cases and controls, exposure assessment, and genetic testing in the IPF JES.
}

\section{\DIFadd{Introduction}}

\DIFadd{The objective of IPF JES is to characterize and measure job exposures as an occupational determinant of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). This will be achieved through a case-control study in which historic job exposures are measured using a validated semi-structured interview. A blood test will also be obtained to investigate interaction between job exposures and IPF genetic susceptibility factors.   
}

\section{\DIFadd{Recruitment}}

\subsection{\DIFadd{Recruitment of cases}}

\DIFadd{See figure ~\ref{fig:caserec}
}

\DIFadd{Cases will be recruited from male patients with a new diagnosis of IPF made during the study period within the research network.
}

\DIFadd{All clinic patients who meet the case inclusion criteria will be provided with a participant information sheet and participant job history sheet. Patients will be enrolled into the study, blood will be drawn, and a case-report form will be completed. The case-report form and blood samples will be placed into a pre-paid Royal Mail container and put in a postbox. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked as part of enrolment. 
}

\DIFadd{The central research team will be updated monthly with details of the number of eligible patients attending clinic, the number of eligible patients approached to participate in the study, and the number of patients agreeing to participate in the study.
}

\DIFadd{Recruitment of cases from a centre stops when the agreed centre target is met or the agreed centre recruitment period ends.

\end{figure}
\subsection{\DIFadd{Recruitment of controls}}

\DIFadd{See figure ~\ref{fig:contrec}
}

 \DIFadd{Controls will be recruited from male patients with a new outpatient department attendance at the same hospital or trust that the cases originate from. Controls will be frequency matched on age to 5-year bands (e.g 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85+). The overall ratio of cases to controls will be 1:1.  
}

\DIFadd{A control clinic will be randomly selected (from all clinics, not limited to respiratory) at each centre. Paediatric clinics and gynaecological clinics will be excluded. This may be achieved by randomly sampling a list of all clinics, by randomly sampling a list of outpatient locations and a time of the week, or by other means. The central research team will provide support for this activity. 
}

\DIFadd{The local research team will write to the lead clinician for the selected clinic to obtain permission to recruit patients to the study. If permission is refused then the process is repeated until a lead clinician agrees. Once agreement is obtained this clinic will be the source clinic for all controls at that centre for the duration of the study.
 }

\DIFadd{Potential controls will be invited to participate in the study and provided with a patient information sheet when they attend the outpatient department. Patients will be enrolled into the study, blood will be drawn, the participant will be provided with a job history sheet, and a case-report form will be completed. The case-report form and blood samples will be placed into a pre-paid Royal Mail container and put in a postbox. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked as part of enrolment.
}

\DIFadd{The central research team will be updated monthly with details of the number of eligible patients attending clinic, the number of eligible patients approached to participate in the study, and the number of patients agreeing to participate in the study.
}

\DIFadd{Recruitment of controls from a centre stops when recruitment of cases stops and one control for each case has been recruited or the agreed centre recruitment period ends.
}

\DIFadd{The exposure assessment is carried out by the central research team by means of a computer-assisted telephone intereview.
}

\DIFaddend \section{Introduction}

Hello, my name is \textbf{name of researcher}. I am a doctor/nurse/research assistant calling as part of the IPF Job Exposure Study. Is this \textbf{name of participant}? 

I would like to ask you some questions about the jobs you have had, where you have lived, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{your lifetime smokinghistory}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{smoking}\DIFaddend . I would also like to record this call for our research if that's ok with you.  

Your answers will help us to understand the causes of IPF, make sure people get the right treatment, and ensure that controls of exposures at work are right so that we protect workers and prevent disease in the future.  

The interview should take about 30 minutes. Is now a good time to talk?

\section{Occupational \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and residential }\DIFdelend history} 

I want you to think about all of the jobs you've had. I know this can be hard, we'll try one at a time. 

Do you remember the first job that you had after school?

 \begin{enumerate} 
\item  What was the name of your job? \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(we record SOC2000 job title and map SOC90)
}\DIFaddend \item  What did you do in this job? \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(we record free text but also have a drop down of activities associated with asbestos exposure)
}\item  \DIFadd{What was the name of the company (if applicable)? (we record name and SIC code, we possibly link to open corporates company house record)
}\DIFaddend \item  What did the company make (if applicable)? \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(we record free text but also have a drop down of asbestos containing products)
}\item  \DIFadd{In what sort of working area did you spend most of your time? e.g Office, In the Open, Workshop, Construction Site, Factory (Light Industry), Heavy Industry (eg. Power Station), Hospital, School/University, Warehouse, “On Location”, various buildings, Shop, At Home, Ship/Ship yard, Other (specify) 
}\item  \DIFadd{Did you work full time? (if not specify average hours per week)
}\item  \DIFadd{Did you work all year round (if not specify months of the year)
}\DIFaddend \item  Do you remember how old you were or what year you started the job?
\item  Do you remember how old you were or what year you finished the job?
\item  Do you remember \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{where you lived when you had that job?
}%DIFDELCMD < \item  %%%
\item%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{Do you remember }\DIFdelend what job you had next?
 \end{enumerate} 

(1 through \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{7 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{10 }\DIFaddend repeats until lifetime occupational history is complete. Standard occupational classification is used to code occupations)

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{`Trigger' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Any reported contact with asbestos or `trigger' products (HSE list), industries (construction, factory work, power station work, other heavy industry, ships or ship yards), }\DIFaddend jobs (see Table ~\ref{table:top15pmr})\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{prompt more detailed questioning regarding job process(es), materials used, and control measures (according to a validated structured subjective  assessment of past concentrations developed by John Cherrie) . Interviewers will receive training from John Cherrie on how to perform this assessment}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and job processes prompts an asbestos exposure history (see later) to be taken}\DIFaddend .
