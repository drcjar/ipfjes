## How to randomly select a control clinic

1. make or obtain a list of clinics (not limited to respiratory clinics) that it is possible for your research team to recruit from
2. make a note of the total number of clinics that this is
3. generate random numbers between 1 and the total number of clinics that this is using [random.org](https://www.random.org/integers/)

For example, if I have 100 clinics locally that the research team can get to recruit from then using [random.org](https://www.random.org/integers/) I would:

> Generate 5 random integers (maximum 10,000).ndom integers (maximum 10,000).
> Each integer should have a value between 1 and 100 (both inclusive; limits ±1,000,000,000).
> Format in 1 column(s).
> Click 'get numbers'

> Here are your random numbers:
> 85
> 92
> 9
> 11
> 36

 

I would then try the 85th clinic on list, then 92nd, then 9th etc.

Naturally you must change the upper limit value (100 above) to however many clinics you have.
