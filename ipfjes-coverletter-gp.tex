\setkomavar{subject}{RE: Joe Bloggs, 12/3/34, NHS number XXX-XXX-XX}

\opening{Dear Doctor,}

    I am writing to inform you that Mr Bloggs has agreed to participate in IPF JES, a multicentre case-control study to investigate job exposures in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
    
    The study includes both patients with (`cases') and without (`controls') IPF and involves an interview to measure historic job exposures and a blood test to investigate susceptibility genetics. I will write to inform you (with your patient's consent) if there are any clinically significant findings for your patient. 
    
    I enclose the participant information sheet and would be happy to answer any questions you might have.




\closing{Yours sincerely}
