\section*{Standard Operating Procedure for case and control recruitment and exposure assessment in the Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Job Exposure Study (IPF JES)}

\tableofcontents

\section{Scope and applicability}

The purpose of this SOP is to describe the instructions for the enrolment of cases and controls, exposure assessment, and genetic testing in the IPF JES.

\section{Introduction}

The objective of IPF JES is to characterize and measure job exposures as an occupational determinant of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). This will be achieved through a case-control study in which historic job exposures are measured using a validated semi-structured interview. A blood test will also be obtained to investigate interaction between job exposures and IPF genetic susceptibility factors.   

\section{Recruitment}

\subsection{Recruitment of cases}

See figure ~\ref{fig:caserec}

Cases will be recruited from male patients with a new diagnosis of IPF made during the study period within the research network.

Centres within the research network will provide the research team with a list of the hospital numbers for all patients newly diagnosed with IPF in the preceding month, on a monthly basis. 

 For each centre the research team will randomly select a sample from the provided list on a monthly basis. The size of the sample \(N_{centre}\) will be calculated as follows 

 \[N_{centre} = tp \times (1/nm)\]

 Where tp = total number of patients on list provided, nm = number of months in the study period. 

 The research team will request that centres write to these patients inviting them to participate in the study and enclosing the patient information sheet. Patients will be enrolled into the study at their next outpatient department, blood will be drawn, and a telephone interview will be scheduled. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked as part of enrolment.

 Recruitment of cases from a centre stops when (460/number of centres) cases are recruited.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Recruitment of controls}

See figure ~\ref{fig:contrec}

Controls will be recruited from male patients with a new outpatient department attendance at the same hospital cases originate from. Controls will be frequency matched on age and the ratio of cases to controls will be 1:1.  

 Centres within the research network will provide the research team with a list of the outpatient clinics (exluding female only clinics and paediatric clinics) that take place each month and an estimate for the number of new male patients seen in each clinic. (n.b this list is provided to the research team only once, it is anticipated that the administrative information needed to create the list will be readily available). 

 The research team will list each clinic alphabetically and serially assign an integer range equal to the expected number of new male patients per clinic per month. The full integer range will then be randomly shuffled and used to derive a list of clinic leads to be approached sequentially as necessary.

The research team will write to the lead clinician for the selected clinic to obtain permission to recruit patients to the study. Potential controls will be invited to participate in the study and provided with a patient information sheet when they attend the outpatient department. Patients will be enrolled into the study at their next outpatient department attendance, blood will be drawn, and a telephone interview will be scheduled. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked as
part of enrolment. (n.b once a control clinic is selected it is used throughout the study).

Recruitment of controls from a centre stops when recruitment of cases stops and one control for each case has been recruited.

\section{Exposure assessment}

\subsection{Introduction}

Hello, my name is \textbf{name of researcher}. I am a doctor/nurse/research assistant calling as part of the IPF Job Exposure Study. Is this \textbf{name of participant}? 

I would like to ask you some questions about the jobs you have had, where you have lived, and your lifetime smoking history. I would also like to record this call for our research if that's ok with you.  

Your answers will help us to understand the causes of IPF, make sure people get the right treatment, and ensure that controls of exposures at work are right so that we protect workers and prevent disease in the future.  

The interview should take about 30 minutes. Is now a good time to talk?

\section{Occupational and residential history} 

I want you to think about all of the jobs you've had. I know this can be hard, we'll try one at a time. 

Do you remember the first job that you had after school?

\begin{enumerate}
\item  What was the name of your job? (we record SOC2000 job title and map SOC90)
\item  What did you do in this job? (we record free text but also have a drop down of activities associated with asbestos exposure)
\item  What was the name of the company (if applicable)? (we record name and SIC code, we possibly link to open corporates company house record)
\item  What did the company make (if applicable)? (we record free text but also have a drop down of asbestos containing products)
\item  In what sort of working area did you spend most of your time? e.g Office, In the Open, Workshop, Construction Site, Factory (Light Industry), Heavy Industry (eg. Power Station), Hospital, School/University, Warehouse, “On Location”, various buildings, Shop, At Home, Ship/Ship yard, Other (specify) 
\item  Did you work full time? (if not specify average hours per week)
\item  Did you work all year round (if not specify months of the year)
\item  Do you remember how old you were or what year you started the job?
\item  Do you remember how old you were or what year you finished the job?
\item  Do you remember where you lived when you had that job?
\item  Do you remember what job you had next?
\end{enumerate}

(1 through 11 repeats until lifetime occupational history is complete. Standard occupational classification is used to code occupations)

Any reported contact with asbestos or `trigger' products (HSE list), industries (construction, factory work, power station work, other heavy industry, ships or ship yards), jobs (see Table ~\ref{table:top15pmr}), and job processes prompts an asbestos exposure history (see later) to be taken.

\section{Venepuncture, sample storage, transportation, and processing} 

Venepuncture will be performed by a qualified practitioner. The number of blood tubes to be drawn depends on the volume of the tubes used. A total of 14mls of blood will be obtained using purple top EDTA tubes and a total of 10mls of blood using gold top SST tubes for each participant. Samples will be labelled with the participants unique research ID and posted using Royal Mail Safebox to a secure lab storage facility at NHLI where they will be kept in a -80 degree centigrade freezer.
The sender will record the day of delivery and the research team will record receipt of the sample and keep an accurate record of its location. Analysis of samples will include DNA isolation and quantitative PCR taqman assay to investigate pre-defined SNPs of interest.
