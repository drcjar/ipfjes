\section*{Interview Schedule for the Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Job Exposure Study (IPF JES)}


\section{Introduction}

Hello, my name is \textbf{name of researcher}. I am a doctor/nurse/research assistant calling as part of the IPF Job Exposure Study. Is this \textbf{name of participant}? 

I would like to ask you some questions about the jobs you have had, where you have lived, and smoking. I would also like to record this call for our research if that's ok with you.  

Your answers will help us to understand the causes of IPF, make sure people get the right treatment, and ensure that controls of exposures at work are right so that we protect workers and prevent disease in the future.  

The interview should take about 30 minutes. Is now a good time to talk?

\section{Occupational history} 

I want you to think about all of the jobs you've had. I know this can be hard, we'll try one at a time. 

Do you remember the first job that you had after school?

\begin{enumerate}
\item  What was the name of your job? (we record SOC2000 job title and map SOC90)
\item  What did you do in this job? (we record free text but also have a drop down of activities associated with asbestos exposure)
\item  What was the name of the company (if applicable)? (we record name and SIC code, we possibly link to open corporates company house record)
\item  What did the company make (if applicable)? (we record free text but also have a drop down of asbestos containing products)
\item  In what sort of working area did you spend most of your time? e.g Office, In the Open, Workshop, Construction Site, Factory (Light Industry), Heavy Industry (eg. Power Station), Hospital, School/University, Warehouse, “On Location”, various buildings, Shop, At Home, Ship/Ship yard, Other (specify) 
\item  Did you work full time? (if not specify average hours per week)
\item  Did you work all year round (if not specify months of the year)
\item  Do you remember how old you were or what year you started the job?
\item  Do you remember how old you were or what year you finished the job?
\item  Do you remember what job you had next?
\end{enumerate}

(1 through 10 repeats until lifetime occupational history is complete. Standard occupational classification is used to code occupations)

Any reported contact with asbestos or `trigger' products (HSE list), industries (construction, factory work, power station work, other heavy industry, ships or ship yards), jobs (see Table ~\ref{table:top15pmr}), and job processes prompts an asbestos exposure history (see later) to be taken.
