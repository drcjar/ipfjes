## How to generate and use a IPFJES participant research ID

- The IPFJES participant research ID is six digits long. The first two digits are the [centre id](https://github.com/drcjar/ipfjes/blob/master/ipfjes-centre-ids.csv). The following four digits are serially assigned to cases and controls. It is important that each participant only has one six digit IPFJES participant research ID and that IPFJES participant research IDs are not duplicated.
- The IPFJES participant research ID is used to label the two provided 10ml blootubes and the case report form. It is also used (together with the participant name) to tell the central research team that a sample is being sent.
