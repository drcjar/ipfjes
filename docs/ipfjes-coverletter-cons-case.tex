\setkomavar{subject}{RE: IPF JES }

\opening{Dear Doctor,}

    We have randomly selected one of your patients (\textbf{NAME, number, dob}) as a potential case in IPF JES, a multicentre case-control study to investigate job exposures in IPF.
    The study involves a short interview to measure historic job exposures and a blood test to investigate susceptibility genetics. I enclose a one-page summary of the study together with the participant information sheet and would be happy to answer any questions you might have.
    Would you be happy to send a cover letter (attached) and information sheet to the patient? We would then hope to enrol them in the study at their next outpatient appointment.



\closing{Yours sincerely}
