\setkomavar{subject}{RE: IPF JES }

\opening{Dear Doctor,}

    We have randomly selected your clinic on date XX/XX/XXXX as a source of potential controls for IPF JES, a multicentre case-control study to investigate job exposures in IPF.
    
    The study involves a short interview to measure historic job exposures and a blood test to investigate susceptibility genetics. I enclose a one-page summary of the study together with the participant information sheet and would be happy to answer any questions you might have.
    
    Would you be happy for us to recruit from your clinic? Perhaps we could meet or speak on the phone to discuss?


\closing{Yours sincerely}
