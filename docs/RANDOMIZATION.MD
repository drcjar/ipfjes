## How to randomly select a control clinic

1. make or obtain a list of clinics (not limited to respiratory clinics) that it is possible for your research team to recruit from
2. make a note of the total number of clinics that this is
3. generate random numbers between 1 and the total number of clinics that this is using [random.org](https://www.random.org/integers/)

For example, if I have 100 clinics locally that the research team can get to recruit from then using [random.org](https://www.random.org/integers/) I would:

> Generate 5 random integers (maximum 10,000).
> Each integer should have a value between 1 and 100 (both inclusive; limits ±1,000,000,000).
> Format in 1 column(s).
> Click 'get numbers'

> Here are your random numbers:
> 85
> 92
> 9
> 11
> 36

 

I would then try the 85th clinic on list, then 92nd, then 9th etc.

Naturally you must change the upper limit value (100 above) to however many clinics you have.

## What to do if there is a problem recruiting from the control clinic because of age matching

1. A problem is defined as four visits to control clinic in a row and fewer than four control clinic patients recruited
2. Tell us and we will review using the screening log.
3. We will then either relax the age bands OR
4. Ask that you find an alternative clinic within the same specialty OR
5. Ask you to randomly select a control clinic again.
