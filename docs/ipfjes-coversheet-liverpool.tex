 \section*{Re: Control Group Recruitment}

Dear Patient,

\vspace{0.5cm}

We would like to invite you to participate in the above research study as part of the control group. This study is being carried out in conjunction with Imperial College of London. 

You will be part of a randomly selected control group, meaning that you do \textbf{NOT} have IPF (a disease where there is scarring of the lungs and we do not the cause) and you are \textbf{NOT} being investigated for IPF. 

The study works by comparing patients who do not have IPF i.e patients like you, called ‘controls’, with patients who do have IPF, called ‘cases’. We are asking you to participate as a control because you do not have IPF.

Control groups play an important role in research studies to compare such things as existing and proposed new treatments, and quality of life data in order to enhance existing treatments or aid the development of new clinical treatments.

This is a voluntary study and will not affect your current or future care or treatment. If you agree to take part in the study, you will be required to sign a consent form agreeing to participation in the study and provide a blood sample which will be taken today/on the day of your routine clinic appointment. You will also be required to participate in a telephone consultation with the central study center to obtain your previous job history (as documented within the job history sheet provided today). 

Please find enclosed a participant information sheet for you to read and contact numbers of the research team if you would like to ask any further questions.

You may withdraw your consent to participate within the study at any time without giving a reason. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Consultant Respiratory Physician and Clinical Lead
